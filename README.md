# sam_cam4blind_demo

This is the demo code for Sam_cam, an app designed for visual impaired people to access visual information in photograph.
It utilizes Segment Anything Model(SAM), Visual Language Models(VLMs), and Dot display.

A Dot display is a required for a visual impaired person to access the visual information.
However, the code of this repo can run without the existance of a Dot Display.
If you are not visual impaired, you can clone and run this repo to see how the whole demo works.
